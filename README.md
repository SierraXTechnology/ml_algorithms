# Machine Learning Examples
## Simple and Multiple Linear Regression
### Used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one (simple) or multiple (multiple) independent variables by modeling a linear relationship.
## K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
### A versatile algorithm used for both classification and regression by predicting the target of a data point based on the majority (classification) or average (regression) of its nearest neighbors.
## Desision Trees
### A flowchart-like model used for both classification and regression, splitting data based on feature values to make predictions or decisions.
## Regression Trees
### A specific type of decision tree used exclusively for predicting continuous target variables by recursively partitioning the feature space and averaging within each region.
## Logistic Regression
### A linear model used for binary (or multi-class) classification tasks by modeling the probability of class membership.
